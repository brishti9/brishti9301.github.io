      <p>Welcome! To the <b>Poseidon's Corner</b>Here you can learn about the oceans of our planet and mythologies from different cultures related to the sea. This site is named after the Greek god of the sea Poseidon.</p>
      <p>Although there is much more to learn, oceanographers have already made some amazing discoveries. For example, we know that the ocean contains towering mountain ranges and deep canyons, known as trenches, just like those on land. The peak of the world’s tallest mountain—Mount Everest in the Himalayas, measuring 8.84 kilometers (5.49 miles) high—would not even break the surface of the water if it was placed in the Pacific Ocean’s Mariana Trench or Philippine Trench, two of the deepest parts of the ocean.</p>
      <p>It is unknown how many different species call the ocean their home. With many marine ecosystems suffering from rising sea temperatures, pollution, and other problems, some oceanographers believe the number of species is dropping. Still, there may be many positive surprises awaiting oceanographers in the years ahead. It could be that more than 90 percent of the ocean’s species are still undiscovered, with some scientists estimating that there are anywhere between a few hundred thousand to a few million more to be discovered. Currently, scientists know of around 226,000 ocean species. </p>
      <p>Our ocean provides countless benefits to our planet and all the creatures that live here. And it is important to conserve and love it.</p>
      <p>This website is made with the hopes to educate you About Oceans and Marine Life</p>
      <p>ENJOY!</p>
